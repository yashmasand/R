# Data Analysis using RStudio

&nbsp;

Here, we have answered the following research questions using R.

1) Is baculum length related to any of the other baculum measurements? 

2) Is baculum length related to any of the other baculum measurements for the three age
groups (yearling, subadult, adult)? 

3) Is baculum length a useful indicator of standard body length (Seal.Lgth)? 


We have attached the following files in the repository:

1) Baculum Dataset
2) Data Analysis report
3) RScript File

The Excel file Baculum.xlsx contains the data on 100 male South African fur seals comprising of yearlings (Age.group = 1), subadults (Age.group = 2) and adults (Age.group = 3).
